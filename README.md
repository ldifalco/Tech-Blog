#Description
My first full stack application 



#Deployed Link
https://shrouded-shore-90952.herokuapp.com


#Installation
run NPM install to install required dependencies

#Usage

User can post and comment on posts created through the dashboard.  The app still has maintanence to be done, and more UI improvements needed.  Will continue to develop this app to improve functionality as well as design.  Despite its current look, I am proud I managed to piece together one of the hardest projects I've ever had to tackle.
